However, many current MAS frameworks struggle with reliability and scalability, especially on complex tasks. We present AgentGit, a framework that brings Git-like rollback and branching to MAS workflows. Built as an infrastructure layer on top of LangGraph, AgentGit supports state commit, revert, and branching, allowing agents to traverse, compare, and explore multiple trajectories efficiently. To evaluate AgentGit, we designed an experiment that optimizes target agents by selecting better prompts. We ran a multi-step A/B test against three baselines—LangGraph, AutoGen, and Agno—on a real-world task: retrieving and analyzing paper abstracts. Results show that AgentGit significantly reduces redundant computation, lowers runtime and token usage, and supports parallel exploration across multiple branches, enhancing both reliability and scalability in MAS development. This work offers a practical path to more robust MAS design and enables error recovery, safe exploration, iterative debugging, and A/B testing in collaborative AI systems.","tags":["multi-agent system","LLM","agent version control"],"title":"AgentGit: A Version Control Framework for Reliable and Scalable LLM-Powered Multi-Agent Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.

Traditionally, the square-root safety rule, based on the Poisson arrival assumption, has been commonly used. However, empirical findings suggest that arrival processes often exhibit an `over-dispersion' phenomenon, in which the variance of the arrival exceeds the mean. In this paper, we develop a new doubly stochastic Poisson process model to capture a significant dispersion scaling law, known as Taylor's law, showing that the variance is a power function of the mean. We further examine how over-dispersion affects staffing, providing a closed-form staffing formula to ensure a desired service level. Interestingly, the additional staffing level beyond the nominal load is a power function of the nominal load, with the power exponent lying between 1/2 (the square-root safety rule) and 1 (the linear safety rule), depending on the degree of over-dispersion. Extensive numerical experiments with both simulated and real arrival data show that our proposed model and staffing rules significantly outperform various alternatives.","tags":["over-dispersion","Taylor's law","doubly stochastic Poisson process","staffing rule"],"title":"Staffing Under Taylor's Law: A Unifying Framework for Bridging Square-Root and Linear Safety Rules","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yanyuan Wang","Xiaowei Zhang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1760160383,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1760160383,"objectID":"dcd45c37263c07181844373ebbf4992a","permalink":"https://xiaoweiz.github.io/publication/wsaa/","publishdate":"2025-03-14T13:26:23+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/wsaa/","section":"publication","summary":"We study uncertainty quantification for contextual stochastic optimization, focusing on weighted sample average approximation (wSAA), which uses machine-learned relevance weights based on covariates.

In addition, computational budgets tie sample size to optimization accuracy, creating a coupling that standard analyses often ignore. We establish central limit theorems for wSAA and construct asymptotic-normality-based confidence intervals for optimal conditional expected costs. We analyze the statistical--computational tradeoff under a computational budget, characterizing how to allocate resources between sample size and optimization iterations to balance statistical and optimization errors. These allocation rules depend on structural parameters of the objective; misspecifying them can break the asymptotic optimality of the wSAA estimator. We show that ''over-optimizing'' (running more iterations than the nominal rule) mitigates this misspecification and preserves asymptotic normality, at the expense of a slight slowdown in the convergence rate of the budget-constrained estimator. The common intuition that ''more data is better'' can fail under computational constraints: increasing the sample size may worsen statistical inference by forcing fewer algorithm iterations and larger optimization error. Our framework provides a principled way to quantify uncertainty for contextual decision-making under computational constraints. It offers practical guidance on allocating limited resources between data acquisition and optimization effort, clarifying when to prioritize additional optimization iterations over more data to ensure valid confidence intervals for conditional performance.","tags":["contextual stochastic optimization","uncertainty quantification","weighted sample average approximation","statistical–computational tradeoff","over-optimizing"],"title":"''Over-Optimizing'' for Normality: Budget-Constrained Uncertainty Quantification for Contextual Decision-Making","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jin Li","Ye Luo","Zigan Wang","Xiaowei Zhang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1759990004,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1759990004,"objectID":"e7e8e9c13cea81d58ca650840f7a87fc","permalink":"https://xiaoweiz.github.io/publication/causal-rl/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T11:27:01+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/causal-rl/","section":"publication","summary":"In the standard data analysis framework, data is collected (once for all), and then data analysis is carried out.

For example, in the automotive industry, car makers decrease the selling prices of fuel-inefficient cars when the oil price rises. Meanwhile, the firm can implement a risk-hedging strategy using the financial asset jointly with its operational decisions. Motivated by this, we develop and solve a general risk-management model integrating risk hedging into a price-setting newsvendor. The optimal hedging strategy is calculated analytically, which leads to an explicit objective function for optimizing price and ``virtual production quantity'' (VPQ). (The latter determines the service level, i.e., the demand fulfillment probability.) We find that hedging generally reduces the optimal price {when the firm sets the target mean return as its production-only maximum expected profit. With the same condition on the target mean return}, hedging also reduces the optimal VPQ when the asset price trend positively impacts product demand; meanwhile, it may increase the VPQ by a small margin when the impact is negative. We construct the return-risk efficient frontier that characterizes the optimal return-risk trade-off. Our numerical study using data from a prominent automotive manufacturer shows that the markdowns in price and reduction in VPQ are small under our model and that the hedging strategy substantially reduces risk without materially reducing operational profit.

The goal of ranking and selection with covariates (R\u0026S-C) is to use sampling to compute a decision rule that can specify the best alternative with certain statistical guarantee for each subsequent individual after observing his or her covariates. A linear model is proposed to capture the relationship between the mean performance of an alternative and the covariates. Under the indifference-zone formulation, we develop two-stage procedures for both homoscedastic and heteroscedastic sampling errors, respectively, and prove their statistical validity, which is defined in terms of probability of correct selection. We also generalize the well-known slippage configuration, and prove that the generalized slippage configuration is the least favorable configuration of our procedures. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed procedures. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of R\u0026S-C via a case study of selecting the best treatment regimen in the prevention of esophageal cancer.

In practice, there may be multiple plausible distributions that can fit the input data reasonably well, especially when the data volume is not large. In this paper, we consider the problem of selecting the best from a finite set of simulated alternatives, in the presence of such input uncertainty. We model such uncertainty by an ambiguity set consisting of a finite number of plausible input distributions, and aim to select the alternative with the best worst-case mean performance over the ambiguity set. We refer to this problem as robust selection of the best (RSB). To solve the RSB problem, we develop a two-stage selection procedure and a sequential selection procedure; we then prove that both procedures can achieve at least a user-specified probability of correct selection under mild conditions. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to investigate the computational efficiency of the two procedures. Finally, we apply the RSB approach to study a queueing system's staffing problem using synthetic data and an appointment scheduling problem using real data from a large hospital in China. We find that the RSB approach can generate decisions significantly better than other widely used approaches.","tags":["ranking and selection","robust optimization","appointment scheduling","input uncertainty"],"title":"Distributionally Robust Selection of the Best","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Modern stochastic systems often have a sophisticated structure.

However, such an enhancement cannot be scaled trivially to high-dimensional design space, since one needs to invert a large covariance matrix that captures the spatial correlations between the responses and the gradient estimates at the design points. Not only is the inversion computationally inefficient, but also numerically unstable since the covariance matrix is often ill-conditioned. We address the scalability issue via a novel approach without resorting to matrix approximations. By virtue of the so-called Markovian covariance functions, the associated covariance matrix can be invertible analytically, thereby improving both the efficiency and stability dramatically.

Its computational bottleneck is the inversion of a covariance matrix, which takes $O(n^3)$ time in general and becomes prohibitive for large $n$, where $n$ is the number of design points. Moreover, the covariance matrix is often ill-conditioned for large $n$, and thus the inversion is prone to numerical instability, resulting in erroneous parameter estimation and prediction. These two numerical issues preclude the use of stochastic kriging at a large scale. This paper presents a novel approach to address them. We construct a class of covariance functions, called Markovian covariance functions (MCFs), which have two properties: (i) the associated covariance matrices  can be inverted analytically, and (ii) the inverse matrices are sparse. With the use of MCFs, the inversion-related computational time is reduced to $O(n^2)$ in general, and can be further reduced by orders of magnitude with additional assumptions on the simulation errors and design points. The analytical invertibility also enhance the numerical stability dramatically. The key  in our approach is that we identify a general functional form of covariance functions that can induce sparsity in the corresponding inverse matrices. We also establish a connection between MCFs and linear ordinary differential equations. Such a connection provides a  flexible, principled approach to constructing a wide class of MCFs. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that stochastic kriging with MCFs can handle large-scale problems in an both computationally efficient and numerically stable manner.","tags":["stochastic kriging","Gaussian process","Markovian covariance function"],"title":"Scalable Stochastic Kriging with Markovian Covariances","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lu Zou","Xiaowei Zhang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1518083284,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1518083284,"objectID":"19526a767a6ee67f00b34e84d6c6530c","permalink":"https://xiaoweiz.github.io/publication/kriging-inadequate/","publishdate":"2021-02-27T11:45:37+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/kriging-inadequate/","section":"publication","summary":"Stochastic kriging is a popular metamodeling technique for representing the unknown response surface of a simulation model. However, the simulation model may be inadequate in the sense that there may be a non-negligible discrepancy between it and the real system of interest.

This paper proposes a metamodel that extends stochastic kriging to incorporate the model discrepancy. Both the simulation outputs and the real data are used to characterize the model discrepancy. The proposed metamodel can provably enhance the prediction of the real system's performance. We derive results for parameter estimation and experiment design, and demonstrate the advantage of the proposed metamodel relative to competing methods. Finally, we study the effect of Common Random Numbers (CRN). The use of CRN is well known to be detrimental to the prediction accuracy of stochastic kriging in general. By contrast, we show that the effect of CRN in the new context is substantially more complex. The use of CRN can be either detrimental or beneficial depending on the interplay between the magnitude of the observation errors and other parameters involved.","tags":["stochastic kriging","Gaussian process"],"title":"Stochastic Kriging for Inadequate Simulation Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haihui Shen","L.

However, several publications in recent years suggest the presence of a significant ''overdisperson'' relative to the Poisson process in real-life call center arrival data. In this paper, we study the overdispersion in the context of ''heavy traffic'' and identify a critical factor that characterizes the stochastic variability of the arrivals to their averages. We refer to such a factor as the scaling parameter and it potentially has a profound impact on the design of staffing rules. We propose an new model to capture the scaling parameter in this paper.","tags":["arrival data","Taylor's law","doubly stochastic Poisson process","overdispersion"],"title":"Scaling and Modeling of Call Center Arrivals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaowei Zhang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1386681379,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1386681379,"objectID":"fa05ca0dcf64537e632c7f1f4ad70ddc","permalink":"https://xiaoweiz.github.io/publication/bayesian-modeling-arrival-wsc/","publishdate":"2021-02-27T11:25:01+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bayesian-modeling-arrival-wsc/","section":"publication","summary":"The Poisson process has been widely used in the literature to model call center arrivals.

In this paper we propose a robust selection of the best (RSB) framework which compares decisions based on their worst-case performances over a finite set of possible distributions and selects the decision with the best worst-case performance. To solve the RSB problems, we design a two-layer R\u0026S procedure under the indifference-zone formulation. The procedure identifies the worst-case distribution in the first stage and the best decision in the second.
