We propose a new sampling algorithm that converges to a global optimal solution and suffers minimally from the curse of dimensionality. The algorithm consists of two stages. First, we take samples following a sparse grid experimental design and approximate the response surface via kernel ridge regression with a Brownian field kernel. Second, we follow the expected improvement strategy---with critical modifications that boost the algorithm's sample efficiency---to iteratively sample from the next level of the sparse grid. Under mild conditions on the smoothness of the response surface and the simulation noise, we establish upper bounds on the convergence rate for both noise-free and noisy simulation samples. These upper bounds deteriorate only slightly in the dimension of the feasible set, and they can be improved if the objective function is known to be of a higher-order smoothness. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm dramatically outperforms typical alternatives in practice.","tags":["simulation optimization","kernel ridge regression","expected improvement","Brownian field","sparse grid","Gaussian process","tensor Markov kernel","experimental design","matrix inversion","high-dimensional"],"title":"High-Dimensional Simulation Optimization via Brownian Fields and Sparse Grids","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liang Ding","Xiaowei Zhang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1623204000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623204000,"objectID":"179a0d4185564337e4622dbcbe1680de","permalink":"https://xiaoweiz.github.io/publication/high-dim-kriging/","publishdate":"2021-06-09T10:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/high-dim-kriging/","section":"publication","summary":"Stochastic kriging has been widely employed for simulation metamodeling to predict the response surface of a complex simulation model.

We model such uncertainty by an ambiguity set consisting of a finite number of plausible input distributions, and aim to select the alternative with the best worst-case mean performance over the ambiguity set. We refer to this problem as robust selection of the best (RSB). To solve the RSB problem, we develop a two-stage selection procedure and a sequential selection procedure; we then prove that both procedures can achieve at least a user-specified probability of correct selection under mild conditions. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to investigate the computational efficiency of the two procedures. Finally, we apply the RSB approach to study a queueing system's staffing problem using synthetic data and an appointment scheduling problem using real data from a large hospital in China.

Motivated by the emerging popularity of personalized decision making in various areas such as healthcare, e-commerce, and wealth management as customer-speciﬁc data grows exponentially, in this talk we introduce a new paradigm called R\u0026S with covariates, where the best alternative is not universal but varies as a function of observable covariates. The goal is then to use sampling to compute a decision rule that specifies the best alternative for each subsequent individual after observing her covariates. We demonstrate the usefulness of our methodology via a case study in personalized medicine for selecting the best cancer treatment regimen.

However, several publications in recent years suggest the presence of a significant ''overdisperson'' relative to the Poisson process in real-life call center arrival data. In this paper, we study the overdispersion in the context of ''heavy traffic'' and identify a critical factor that characterizes the stochastic variability of the arrivals to their averages. We refer to such a factor as the scaling parameter and it potentially has a profound impact on the design of staffing rules. We propose an new model to capture the scaling parameter in this paper.","tags":["arrival data","Taylor's law","doubly stochastic Poisson process","overdispersion"],"title":"Scaling and Modeling of Call Center Arrivals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaowei Zhang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1386681379,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1386681379,"objectID":"fa05ca0dcf64537e632c7f1f4ad70ddc","permalink":"https://xiaoweiz.github.io/publication/bayesian-modeling-arrival-wsc/","publishdate":"2021-02-27T11:25:01+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bayesian-modeling-arrival-wsc/","section":"publication","summary":"The Poisson process has been widely used in the literature to model call center arrivals.

In this paper we propose a robust selection of the best (RSB) framework which compares decisions based on their worst-case performances over a finite set of possible distributions and selects the decision with the best worst-case performance. To solve the RSB problems, we design a two-layer R\u0026S procedure under the indifference-zone formulation. The procedure identifies the worst-case distribution in the first stage and the best decision in the second. We prove the statistical validity of the two-layer procedure and test its performance numerically.","tags":["ranking and selection","robust optimization","input uncertainty"],"title":"Robust Selection of the Best","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter W.
