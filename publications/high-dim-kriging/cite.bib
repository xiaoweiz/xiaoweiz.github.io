    abstract = { High-dimensional Simulation MetamodelingStochastic kriging has been widely employed for simulation metamodeling to predict the response surface of complex simulation models. However, its use is limited to cases where the design space is low-dimensional because the sample complexity (i.e., the number of design points required to produce an accurate prediction) grows exponentially in the dimensionality of the design space. The large sample size results in both a prohibitive sample cost for running the simulation model and a severe computational challenge due to the need to invert large covariance matrices. To address this long-standing challenge, Liang Ding and Xiaowei Zhang, in their recent paper “Sample and Computationally Efficient Stochastic Kriging in High Dimensions”, develop a novel methodology — based on tensor Markov kernels and sparse grid experimental designs — that dramatically alleviates the curse of dimensionality. The proposed methodology has theoretical guarantees on both sample complexity and computational complexity and shows outstanding performance in numerical problems of as high as 16,675 dimensions. }
